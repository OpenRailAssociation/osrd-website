&lt;p>On 29 and 30 June, the &lt;a href="https://bcc.oebb.at/de/das-leisten-wir/innovationen/dreilaenderhack">&amp;ldquo;Dreiländer hack&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> (the hackathon of the three countries) was held in Wien (Austria). Organised by DB (Germany), ÖBB (Austria) and SBB (Switzerland), this is an annual event dedicated to collaboration on shared railway-related challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were delighted to be invited to take part thanks to the &lt;a href="https://openrailassociation.org/">OpenRail association&lt;/a>, and this year&amp;rsquo;s theme being &amp;ldquo;Open Railways&amp;rdquo;, it would have been hard to refuse!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DGEX Solutions Forum</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/blog/2023/04/12/dgex-solutions-forum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/blog/2023/04/12/dgex-solutions-forum/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dgex-solutions-forum">DGEX Solutions Forum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an extract from Loïc Hamelin&amp;rsquo;s talk at the DGEX Solutions forum, on the subject of search for last-minute train slots (STDCM).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="first-of-all-what-is-a-train-path">First of all, what is a train path?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the reservation of space/time on the network, by railway undertakings (RU) such as SNCF Voyageurs. These reservations are generally made years in advance (A-3). RUs can also make emergency requests for train paths (called last-minute paths), from A-1 to D-day.
These requests are currently managed by ticket offices, and the paths are traced by hand. There is therefore a risk of human error, and requests are sometimes processed over several days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenStreetMap and open data talk at Fosdem 2023</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/blog/2023/02/03/openstreetmap-and-open-data-talk-at-fosdem-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/blog/2023/02/03/openstreetmap-and-open-data-talk-at-fosdem-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi ! My name is Céline, and I am on a mission to bring more open data into OSRD. To do so, I searched open data that can fit OSRD&amp;rsquo;s needs in every country of the European Union (+ Norway, United Kingdom and Switzerland).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have presented the main results of this study during a talk at the FOSDEM 2023 meeting, and you can see the replay on &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/railways_and_open_transport/">their website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post I will go into details of the methodology I followed, feel free to contact me if you have any remarks or question :-)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
