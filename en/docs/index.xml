&lt;p>Some definitions:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="capacity">Capacity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Capacity&lt;/strong>, in this context, is the ability to
reserve infrastructure elements to allow the passage of a train.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capacity is expressed in both space and time:
the reservation of an element can block a specific zone
that becomes inaccessible to other trains, and this reservation
lasts for a given time interval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be displayed
on a chart, with the time on the horizontal axis
and the distance traveled on the vertical axis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="space_time_chart.png" alt="Space-time chart">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Example of a space-time chart displaying the passage of a train.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The colors here represent aspects of the signals, but
display a consumption of the capacity as well:
when these blocks overlap for two trains, they conflict.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There is a &lt;strong>conflict&lt;/strong> between two trains when they reserve
the same object at the same time, in incompatible configurations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="conflict.png" alt="Space-time chart with conflict">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Example of a space-time graph with a conflict: the second train
is faster than the first one, they are in conflict at the end
of the path, when the rectangles overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When simulating this timetable, the second train would be
slowed down by the yellow signals, caused by the
presence of the first train.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="train-slots">Train slots&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>train slot&lt;/strong> corresponds to a capacity reservation
for the passage of a train. It is fixed in space and time:
the departure time and the path taken are known.
On the space-time charts in this page, a train slot corresponds
to the set of blocks displayed for a train.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Note: in English-speaking countries, these are often simply called &amp;ldquo;train paths&amp;rdquo;.
But in this context, this name would be ambiguous with the
physical path taken by the train.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The usual procedure is for the infrastructure manager
(e.g. SNCF Réseau) to offers train slots for sale to
railway companies (e.g. SNCF Voyageurs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a given date before the scheduled day of operation,
all the train paths are allocated. But &lt;strong>there may be
enough capacity to fit more trains&lt;/strong>. Trains can fit between
scheduled slots,
when they are sufficiently far apart or have not found a buyer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remaining capacity after the allocation of train paths is called
&lt;strong>residual capacity&lt;/strong>. This section explains how OSRD looks
for train slots in this residual capacity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Input format</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/inputs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/inputs/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This module takes several parameters to find a path:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A graph describing the physical infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unavailable sections in time intervals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Origin and destination point(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Departure time interval&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maximum run time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simulation parameters (rolling stock, time step, allowances, &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Among those, the first 3 require more explanations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="infrastructure-graph">Infrastructure graph&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Today, the input graph is the &lt;code>SignalingRoutes&lt;/code> graph.
But it can be any graph that represents the physical infrastructures
and the paths that can be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only constraints are: the edges must have a length, and it must
be possible to compute running time on parts of an edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="unavailable-sections">Unavailable sections&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This input encodes the areas that are unavailable because of
capacity constraints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every edge has a set of &amp;ldquo;occupancy block&amp;rdquo;. A block is made of these elements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start offset&lt;/li>
&lt;li>End offset&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>End time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Offsets are relative to the start of the edge. Each block means that
the &lt;em>head&lt;/em> of the train cannot be located in the edge
segment during the given interval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These blocks include the grid margin. If the solution needs to have
an &lt;code>x&lt;/code> seconds margin before the train passage, every block ends
&lt;code>x&lt;/code> seconds later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give an example, with the following schedule, a 42m long train,
and 10m sight distance:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="unavailable_sections.svg" alt="Unavailable section example">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The occupancy of the block 1 from t=0 to t=300 makes it unavailable
in its entirety during this time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The last 10 meters of block 1 are unavailable from t=300 to t=360,
because the signal at the start of block 2 must be green when the
conductor sees it. It is possible to consider that this unavailability block
starts at t=130 (when the next signal isn&amp;rsquo;t green), as blocks can overlap.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The occupancy of block 2 from t=130 to t=360 makes it unavailable
during this time. It is also unavailable from t=0, as the presence of a
train in this block would cause a warning on block 1.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first 42 meters of block 3 are unavailable from t=0 to t=360,
because the tail of the train must have left the block 2 at this time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rest of block 3 is unavailable in its entirety from t=280 to t=360&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: Physical modeling</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/physical_modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/physical_modeling/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Physical modelling plays an important role in the OSRD core calculation. It allows us to simulate train traffic, and it must be as realistic as possible train traffic, and it must be as realistic as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="force-review">Force review&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>To calculate the displacement of the train over time, we must first calculate its speed at each instant.
A simple way to obtain this speed is to calculate the acceleration.
Thanks to the fundamental principle of dynamics, the acceleration of the train at each instant is directly dependent on the different forces applied to it: $$ \sum \vec{F}=m\vec{a} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../forces.png" alt="Running time">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Traction&lt;/strong>: The value of the traction force \(F_{mot}\) depends on several factors:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the rolling stock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the speed of the train, \(v^{\prime}x\) according to the effort-speed curve below:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$ {\vec{F_{mot}}(v_{x^{\prime}}, x^{\prime})=F_{mot}(v_{x^{\prime}}, x^{\prime})\vec{e_x^{\prime}}} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../effort-vitesse.png" alt="Running time" title="Example of a train effort-speed curve">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>x&lt;/strong> axis represents the speed of the train in [km/h], the &lt;strong>y&lt;/strong> axis the value of the traction force in [kN].&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the action of the driver, who accelerates more or less strongly depending on where he is on his journey&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;br>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Braking&lt;/strong> : The value of the braking force \(F_{brk}\) also depends on the rolling stock and the driver&amp;rsquo;s action but has a constant value for a given rolling stock. In the current state of modelling, braking is either zero or at its maximum value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$ \vec{F_{brk}}(x^{\prime})=-F_{brk}(x^{\prime}){\vec{e_{x^{\prime}}}} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A second approach to modelling braking is the so-called hourly approach, as it is used for hourly production at SNCF. In this case, the deceleration is fixed and the braking no longer depends on the different forces applied to the train. Typical deceleration values range from 0.4 to 0.7m/s².&lt;/p>
&lt;br>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Forward resistance&lt;/strong>: To model the forward resistance of the train, the Davis formula is used, which takes into account all the friction and aerodynamic resistance of the air. The value of the drag depends on the speed \(v^{\prime}_x\). The coefficients \(A\), \(B\), et \(C\) depend on the rolling stock.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$ {\vec{R}(v_{x^{\prime}})}=-(A+Bv_{x^{\prime}}+{Cv_{x^{\prime}}}^2){\vec{e_{x^{\prime}}}} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;br>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Weight (slopes + turns)&lt;/strong> : The weight force given by the product between the mass \(m\) of the train and the gravitational constant \(g\) is projected on the axes \(\vec{e_x}^{\prime}\) and \(\vec{e_y}^{\prime}\).For projection, we use the angle \(i(x^{\prime})\), which is calculated from the slope angle \(s(x^{\prime})\) corrected by a factor that takes into account the effect of the turning radius \(r(x^{\prime})\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$
\vec{P(x^{\prime})}=-mg\vec{e_y}(x^{\prime})=
-mg\Big[sin\big(i(x^{\prime})\big){\vec{e_{x^{\prime}}}(x^{\prime})}+cos\big(i(x^{\prime})\big){\vec{e_{{\prime}}}(x^{\prime})}\Big]
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ i(x^{\prime})= s(x^{\prime})+\frac{800m}{r(x^{\prime})} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;br>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ground Reaction&lt;/strong> : The ground reaction force simply compensates for the vertical component of the weight, but has no impact on the dynamics of the train as it has no component along the axis \({\vec{e_x}^{\prime}}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$ \vec{R_{gnd}}=R_{gnd}{\vec{e_{y^{\prime}}}} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="forces-balance">Forces balance&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The equation of the fundamental principle of dynamics projected onto the axis \({\vec{e_x}^{\prime}}\) (in the train frame of reference) gives the following scalar equation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
a_{x^{\prime}}(t) = \frac{1}{m}\Big
[F_{mot}(v_{x^{\prime}}, x^{\prime})-F_{brk}(x^{\prime})-(A+Bv_{x^{\prime}}+{Cv_{x^{\prime}}}^2)-mgsin(i(x^{\prime}))\Big]
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is then simplified by considering that despite the gradient the train moves on a plane and by amalgamating
\(\vec{e_x}\) and \(\vec{e_x}^{\prime}\). The gradient still has an impact on the force balance, but it is assumed that the train is only moving horizontally, which gives the following simplified equation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ a_{x}(t) = \frac{1}{m}\Big[F_{mot}(v_{x}, x)-F_{brk}(x)-(A+Bv_{x}+{Cv_{x}}^2)-mgsin(i(x))\Big] $$&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="resolution">Resolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The driving force and the braking force depend on the driver&amp;rsquo;s action (he decides to accelerate or brake more or less strongly depending on the situation). This dependence is reflected in the dependence of these two forces on the position of the train. The weight component is also dependent on the position of the train, as it comes directly from the slopes and bends below the train.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, the driving force depends on the speed of the train (according to the speed effort curve) as does the resistance to forward motion.
resistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These different dependencies make it impossible to solve this equation analytically, and the acceleration of the train at each moment must be calculated by numerical integration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About: Strategic timetable</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/about/use-case/strategic-timetable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/about/use-case/strategic-timetable/</guid><description>

&lt;h3 id="presentation">Presentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>A first phase of the transportation plan design process starts very early: Y-10 of the day the train is to run and aims to &lt;strong>propose several traffic scenarios&lt;/strong> on existing or prospective rail infrastructure. In this phase, SNCF Réseau, the French railway infrastructure manager and responsible for the allocation and sale of train paths, collects requests from &lt;strong>OA&lt;/strong> (Organizing Authorities) and &lt;strong>RC&lt;/strong> (Railway Companies) in terms of mobility. The requests will be transmitted in the form of &lt;strong>service plans&lt;/strong>. A service plan is a way of representing the requested trains, their route and the stops to be served.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>OSRD Strategic Schedules&lt;/strong> product has been designed to build an operating plan from the service diagrams, based on &lt;strong>rail infrastructure modeling, running calculation and simulation&lt;/strong>. Building an operating plan means scheduling the trains presented on the service diagrams in a way that best meets the mobility needs. The OSRD tool provides a database with a &lt;strong>micro-model of the French railway infrastructure&lt;/strong> as well as the &lt;strong>rolling stock already in use in France&lt;/strong>. Moreover, an interface to modify the existing infrastructure or to design a new part of the infrastructure is proposed. The output products of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>OSRD Strategic Schedules&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; process are timetables where the train schedules are displayed. A graphical representation of the timetables is thus proposed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A comprehensive and strategic view of the timetable planning is crucial to improve rail performance. &lt;strong>The ultimate goal is to meet mobility needs by optimizing line capacity utilization, station track occupancy and material turnover&lt;/strong>. To meet this optimization requirement, we are working to implement mathematical modeling and resolution modules coupled with the simulator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Encoding the solution space</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/graph_representation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/graph_representation/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The problem is still a pathfinding problem in a given graph.
Once the problem is encoded as a graph search, it is possible to reuse
our existing tools for this purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We consider the &lt;em>product graph&lt;/em> of position, time, and speed.
This means that every graph element contains these 3 variables
(among other things)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every graph edge is computed using
&lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/" title="running-time calculation">running-time calculation&lt;/a>
to get speed and positions as functions of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="graphical-representation">Graphical representation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Space is encoded with a graph that contains the physical infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="routes_time_1.png" alt="product graph (1/3)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is then &amp;ldquo;duplicated&amp;rdquo; at different times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="routes_time_2.png" alt="product graph (2/3)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nodes are then linked together in a way that reflects travel time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="notes">Notes&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The graph is constructed on the fly as it is explored.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is &lt;em>discretized&lt;/em> in time, to evaluate which nodes have already
been visited. We keep full accuracy of time values, but two nodes
at the same place and close times are considered identical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every edge is computed with a running time computation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speed isn&amp;rsquo;t discretized or considered to check visited nodes,

&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Since physical modelling has shown that the acceleration of the train is influenced by various factors that vary along the route (gradient, curvature, engine traction force, etc.), the calculation must be carried out using a numerical integration method. The path is then separated into sufficiently short steps to consider all these factors as constant, which allows this time to use the equation of motion to calculate the displacement and speed of the train.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Euler&amp;rsquo;s method of numerical integration is the simplest way of doing this, but it has a number of drawbacks. This article explains the Euler method, why it is not suitable for OSRD purposes and which integration method should be used instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="eulers-method">Euler&amp;rsquo;s method&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The Euler method applied to the integration of the equation of motion of a train is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$v(t+dt) = a(v(t), x(t))dt + v(t)$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$x(t+dt) = \frac{1}{2}a(v(t), x(t))dt^2 + v(t)dt + x(t)$$&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="advantages-of-eulers-method">&lt;strong>Advantages of Euler&amp;rsquo;s method&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The advantages of the Euler method are that it is very simple to implement and has a rather fast calculation for a given time step, compared to other numerical integration methods (see &lt;a href="#the-choice-of-integration-method-for-osrd">appendix&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="disadvantages-of-the-eulers-method">&lt;strong>Disadvantages of the Euler&amp;rsquo;s method&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The Euler integration method presents a number of problems for OSRD:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is relatively imprecise, and therefore requires a small time step, which generates a lot of data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With time integration, only the conditions at the starting point of the integration step (gradient, infrastructure parameters, etc.) are known, as one cannot predict precisely where it will end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We cannot anticipate future changes in the directive: the train only reacts by comparing its current state with its set point at the same time. To illustrate, it is as if the driver is unable to see ahead, whereas in reality he anticipates according to the signals, slopes and bends he sees ahead.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="runge-kuttas-4-method">Runge-Kutta&amp;rsquo;s 4 method&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The Runge-Kutta 4 method applied to the integration of the equation of motion of a train is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$v(t+dt) = v(t) + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)dt$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$k_1 = a(v(t), x(t))$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$k_2 = a\Big(v(t+k_1\frac{dt}{2}), x(t) + v(t)\frac{dt}{2} + k_1\frac{dt^2}{8}\Big)$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$k_3 = a\Big(v(t+k_2\frac{dt}{2}), x(t) + v(t)\frac{dt}{2} + k_2\frac{dt^2}{8}\Big)$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$k_4 = a\Big(v(t+k_3dt), x(t) + v(t)dt + k_3\frac{dt^2}{2}\Big)$$&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Runge Kutta&amp;rsquo;s method of integration 4 addresses the various problems raised by Euler&amp;rsquo;s method:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It allows the anticipation of directive changes within a calculation step, thus representing more accurately the reality of driving a train.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is more accurate for the same calculation time (see &lt;a href="#the-choice-of-integration-method-for-osrd">appendix&lt;/a>), allowing for larger integration steps and therefore fewer data points.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Different integration methods could have replaced the basic Euler integration in the OSRD algorithm. In order to decide which method would be most suitable, a study of the accuracy and computational speed of different methods was carried out. This study compared the following methods:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Euler&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Euler-Cauchy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Runge-Kutta 4&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adams 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adams 3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All explanations of these methods can be found (in french) in &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/wiki/documents/integration/MethodesNumeriques_EricGoncalves.pdf">this document&lt;/a>, and the python code used for the simulation is &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/DGEXSolutions/osrd/code/integration/Tests_precision.py">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simulation calculates the position and speed of a high-speed train accelerating on a flat straight line.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="equivalent-time-step-simulations">&lt;strong>Equivalent time step simulations&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A reference curve was simulated using the Euler method with a time step of 0.1s, then the same path was simulated using the other methods with a time step of 1s. It is then possible to simply compare each curve to the reference curve, by calculating the absolute value of the difference at each calculated point. The resulting absolute error of the train&amp;rsquo;s position over its distance travelled is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../precisions_h_equivalent.png" alt="precisions_h_equivalent">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is immediately apparent that the Euler method is less accurate than the other four by about an order of magnitude. Each curve has a peak where the accuracy is extremely high (extremely low error), which is explained by the fact that all curves start slightly above the reference curve, cross it at one point and end slightly below it, or &lt;em>vice versa&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As accuracy is not the only important indicator, the calculation time of each method was measured. This is what we get for the same input parameters:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th style="text-align:left">Integration method&lt;/th>
&lt;th style="text-align:right">Calculation time (s)&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Euler&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">1.86&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Euler-Cauchy&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">3.80&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Runge-Kutta 4&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">7.01&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Adams 2&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">3.43&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Adams 3&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">5.27&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Thus, Euler-Cauchy and Adams 2 are about twice as slow as Euler, Adams 3 is about three times as slow, and RK4 is about four times as slow. These results have been verified on much longer simulations, and the different ratios are maintained.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="simulation-with-equivalent-calculation-time">&lt;strong>Simulation with equivalent calculation time&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As the computation times of all methods depend linearly on the time step, it is relatively simple to compare the accuracy for approximately the same computation time. Multiplying the time step of Euler-Cauchy and Adams 2 by 2, the time step of Adams 3 by 3, and the time step of RK4 by 4, here are the resulting absolute error curves:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../precisions_time_equivalent.png" alt="precisions_time_equivalent">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here are the calculation times:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th style="text-align:left">Integration method&lt;/th>
&lt;th style="text-align:right">Calculation time (s)&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Euler&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">1.75&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Euler-Cauchy&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">2.10&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Runge-Kutta 4&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">1.95&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Adams 2&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">1.91&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:left">Adams 3&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:right">1.99&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>After some time, RK4 tends to be the most accurate method, slightly more accurate than Euler-Cauchy, and still much more accurate than the Euler method.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="conclusions-of-the-study">Conclusions of the study&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The study of accuracy and computational speed presented above shows that RK4 and Euler-Cauchy would be good candidates to replace the Euler algorithm in OSRD: both are fast, accurate, and could replace the Euler method without requiring large implementation changes because they only compute within the current time step.
&lt;strong>It was decided that OSRD would use the Runge-Kutta 4 method because it is slightly more accurate than Euler-Cauchy and it is a well-known method for this type of calculation, so it is very suitable for an open-source simulator.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Millions of Euros are invested each year in rail projects on the basis of operational studies. The objectives of these studies are &lt;strong>to match transport needs with the rail infrastructure and to assess the capacity of the network to meet these needs&lt;/strong>. Operational studies, which are strategic and crucial for informing public investment decisions concerning the future of the rail network and for the performance of the rail system, require rare and exclusive skills and &lt;strong>currently produce scattered and poorly capitalized data&lt;/strong>. For this reason, SNCF Réseau has chosen in 2019 to equip itself with an in-house tool to carry out these studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>OSRD Operational Studies&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; project was born in response to the shortcomings of the market: numerous and expensive tools, closed and with non-comparable results. On the contrary, we propose a reference tool accessible to all, whose results are transparent, explicit and universal. The OSRD tool provides a database with a microscopic modeling of the French railway infrastructure (gradients, radii of curvature, limiting speeds). An interface to modify the existing infrastructure or to design a new part of the infrastructure is proposed.
Thanks to this modeling and to its running calculation engine, OSRD can calculate routes, draw paths, simulate trains and their interaction with the signaling system.
OSRD meets the &lt;strong>stakes of sustainable mobility&lt;/strong> by optimizing energy consumption. The expected regularity margin on the running of a train is distributed according to an &lt;strong>algorithm that minimizes the energy consumed by the train during the journey&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting element of verification of an exploitation scenario is &lt;strong>the evaluation of the robustness&lt;/strong> of what is projected. For this function, a &lt;strong>stochastic simulation module&lt;/strong> is proposed. Hazards can be modeled and injected into the simulator to evaluate the consequences and the ability of the system to return to balance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Infrastructure data</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/data-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/data-model/</guid><description>

&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>This page gives an example of how the data formats are used to describe an infrastructure in &lt;strong>OSRD&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this purpose, let&amp;rsquo;s take as an example the following toy infrastructure:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_diagram.drawio.en.svg" alt="Toy infrastructure diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Tip&lt;/h4>
To zoom in on diagrams, click on the edit button that appears when hovering over it.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This diagram is an overview of the infrastructure with lines and stations only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This infrastructure is not meant to be realistic, but rather meant to help illustrate OSRD&amp;rsquo;s data model.
This example will be created step by step and explained along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-infrastructure-generator">The infrastructure generator&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd">&lt;em>OSRD&lt;/em> repository&lt;/a> is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/tree/dev/core/examples/generated">python library&lt;/a> designed to help generate infrastructures in a format understood by &lt;em>OSRD&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The infrastructure discussed in this section can be generated thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/scripts/small_infra.py">small_infra.py&lt;/a> file. To learn more about the generation scripts, you can check out the related &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/README.md">README&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="tracks">Tracks&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;h4 id="track-sections">Track sections&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first objects we need to define are &lt;code>TrackSections&lt;/code>. Most other objects are positioned relative to track sections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A track section is a section of rail (switches not included). One can chose to divide the tracks of their infrastructure in as many track sections as they like. Here we chose to use the longest track sections possible, which means that between two switches there is always a single track section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Track sections is what simulated trains roll onto. They are the abstract equivalent to physical rail sections. Track sections are bidirectional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, we define two tracks for the line between the West and North-East stations. We also have overpassing tracks at the North and Mid-West stations for added realism. Finally, we have three separate tracks in the West station, since it&amp;rsquo;s a major hub in our imaginary infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails.drawio.en.svg" alt="Track sections diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Important&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;code>TrackSections&lt;/code> are represented as arrows in this diagram to stress the fact that they have a &lt;strong>start&lt;/strong> and an &lt;strong>end&lt;/strong>. It matters as objects positioned on track sections are located using their distance from the &lt;strong>start&lt;/strong> of their track section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, to locate an object at the beginning of its track section, set its offset to 0. To move it to the end of its track section, set its offset to the &lt;code>length&lt;/code> of the track section.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>These attributes are required for the track section to be complete:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>length&lt;/code>: the length of the track section in meters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>geo&lt;/code>: the coordinates in real life (geo is for geographic), in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON&lt;/a> format.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>sch&lt;/code>: the coordinates in the schematic view (sch for schematic), also in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON&lt;/a> format.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cosmetic attributes: &lt;code>line_name&lt;/code>, &lt;code>track_name&lt;/code>, &lt;code>track_number&lt;/code> which are used to indicate the name and labels that were given to the tracks / lines in real life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For all track sections in our infrastructure, the &lt;code>geo&lt;/code> and &lt;code>sch&lt;/code> attributes are identical, and very much resemble the given diagram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most track sections, their &lt;code>length&lt;/code> is proportional to what can be seen in the diagram. To preserve readability, exceptions were made for &lt;em>TA6&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA7&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TD0&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TD1&lt;/em> (which are 10km and 25km).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="track-section-links">Track Section Links&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the moment we only created track sections, which are not connected to each other (geospacial data is not used to deduce which tracks connect).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>TrackSectionLinks&lt;/code> are used to connect two track sections together, just like a weld joint would in real life. In an OSRD simulation, a train can go from one track section to another only if they are connected by a &lt;code>TrackSectionLink&lt;/code> (or by a &lt;code>Switch&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To connect more than two &lt;code>TrackSections&lt;/code> together, use the &lt;a href="#switches">&lt;code>Switches&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our infrastructure, since we chose to have our track sections as long as possible, we do not actually need to use &lt;code>TrackSectionLinks&lt;/code>.
&lt;code>TrackSectionLinks&lt;/code> are always optional: two track sections connected by a link behave just like a single track section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="switches">Switches&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A &lt;code>Switch&lt;/code> represents just what you would expect: railway switches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Switches can be thought of as a collections of track section links, partitioned into groups. Each group represents for a switch state. Switching group can take time, and at most one link can be ready to use at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the real world, switches are not unique, but rather instances of existing models.
Thus, links and groups are not part of the switch itself, but in a &lt;code>SwitchType&lt;/code> object, which is shared by switches of the same model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="switch-types">Switch Types&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SwitchTypes&lt;/code> have two mandatory attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>ports&lt;/code>: A list of port names. A port is an endpoint which can be connected to a track section.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>groups&lt;/code>: A mapping from group names to lists of links between two ports.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At any time, all switches have an active group, and may have an active link, which always belongs to the active group. If there is an active link, it is active in a given direction. During a simulation, changing active link inside a group is instantaneous, but changing active link across groups takes configurable time.
This is because a switch is a physical object, and changing active link can involve moving parts of it. &lt;code>Groups&lt;/code> are designed to represent the different positions that a switch can have. Each &lt;code>group&lt;/code> contains the links that can be used in the associated switch position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The duration needed to change group is stored inside the &lt;code>Switch&lt;/code>, since it can vary depending on the physical implementation of the switch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our examples currently use three switch types. Switch types are just like other objects, and can easily be added as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1) The Point Switch&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ubiquitous Y switch, which can be thought of as either two tracks merging, or one track splitting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This switch type has three ports: &lt;em>base&lt;/em>, &lt;em>left&lt;/em> and &lt;em>right&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/point_switch.en.svg" alt="Point switch diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two groups, each with one connection in their list: &lt;code>LEFT&lt;/code>, which connects &lt;em>base&lt;/em> to &lt;em>left&lt;/em>, and &lt;code>RIGHT&lt;/code> which connects &lt;em>base&lt;/em> to &lt;em>right&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, at any given moment, a train can go from &lt;em>base&lt;/em> to &lt;em>left&lt;/em> or from &lt;em>base&lt;/em> to &lt;em>right&lt;/em> but never to both at the same time. A train cannot go from &lt;em>left&lt;/em> to &lt;em>right&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Point Switch only has two positions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/point_switch_positions.en.svg" alt="Point switch positions diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2) The Cross Switch&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is simply two tracks crossing each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This type has four ports: &lt;em>north&lt;/em>, &lt;em>south&lt;/em>, &lt;em>east&lt;/em> and &lt;em>west&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/cross_switch.en.svg" alt="Cross switch diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has only one group containing two connections: &lt;em>north&lt;/em> to &lt;em>south&lt;/em> and &lt;em>west&lt;/em> to &lt;em>east&lt;/em>. Indeed this kind of switch is &lt;em>passive&lt;/em>: it has no moving parts. Despite having a single group, it is still used by the simulation to enforce route reservations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the two different connections that this switch type has:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/cross_switch_positions.en.svg" alt="Cross switch positions diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3) The Double cross switch&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one is more like two point switches back to back. It has four ports: &lt;em>south1&lt;/em>, &lt;em>south2&lt;/em>, &lt;em>north1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>north2&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch.en.svg" alt="Double cross switch diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it has four groups, each with one connection. The four groups are represented in the following diagram:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch_positions.en.svg" alt="Double cross switch positions diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="back-to-switches">Back to switches&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>A &lt;code>Switch&lt;/code> has three attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>switch_type&lt;/code>: the &lt;a href="#switch-types">&lt;code>SwitchType&lt;/code>&lt;/a> identifier for this switch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>ports&lt;/code>: a mapping from port names to track sections extremities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>group_change_delay&lt;/code>: the time it takes to change which group of the switch is activated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The port names must match the ports of the switch type chosen. The track section endpoints can be start or end, be careful to chose the appropriate ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of our example&amp;rsquo;s switches are regular point switches. The path from North station to South station has two cross switches, and there is a double cross switch right before the main line splits into the North-East and South-East lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails_n_points.drawio.en.svg" alt="Track sections and points diagram">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="curves-and-slopes">Curves and slopes&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Curves&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Slopes&lt;/code> are instrumental to realistic simulations. These objects are defined as a range between a &lt;code>begin&lt;/code> and &lt;code>end&lt;/code> offsets of one track section. If a curve / slope spans more than one track section, it has to be added to all of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The slope / curve values are constant on their entire range. For varying curves / slopes, one needs to create several objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slope values are measured in &lt;em>meters per kilometers&lt;/em>, and the curve values are measured in &lt;em>meters&lt;/em> (the radius of the curve).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Mind that the &lt;code>begin&lt;/code> value should always be smaller than the &lt;code>end&lt;/code> value. That is why the curve / slope values can be negative: an uphill slope of 1 going from offset 10 to 0 is the same as a downhill slope of -1 going from offsets 0 to 10.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/scripts/small_infra.py">small_infra.py&lt;/a> file, we have slopes on the track sections &lt;em>TA6&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA7&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TD0&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TD1&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are curves as well, on the track sections &lt;em>TE0&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TE1&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TE3&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TF1&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="interlocking">Interlocking&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>All objects so far contributed to track topology (shape). Topology would be enough for trains to navigate the network, but not enough to do so safely. to ensure safety, two systems collaborate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Interlocking ensures trains are allowed to move forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Signaling is the mean by which interlocking communicates with the train&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="detectors">Detectors&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>These objects are used to create TVD sections (Track Vacancy Detection section): the track area in between detectors is a TVD section. When a train runs into a detector, the section it is entering becomes occupied. The only function of TVD sections is to locate trains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In real life, detectors can be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle_counter">axle counters&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit">track circuits&lt;/a> for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this mean of location to be efficient, detectors need to be placed regularly along your tracks, not too many because of cost, but not too few, because then TVD sections would be very large and trains would need to be very far apart to be told apart, which reduces capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There often are detectors close to all sides of switches. This way, interlocking is made aware pretty much immediately when a switch is cleared, which is then free to be used again.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a cross switch as an example: if train A is crossing it &lt;em>north&lt;/em> to &lt;em>south&lt;/em> and train B is coming to cross &lt;em>west&lt;/em> to &lt;em>east&lt;/em>, then as soon as train A&amp;rsquo;s last car has passed the crossing, B should be able to go, since A is now on a completely unrelated track section.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>OSRD&lt;/em>, detectors are point objects, so all the attributes it needs are its &lt;code>id&lt;/code>, and track location (&lt;code>track&lt;/code> and &lt;code>offset&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_detectors.drawio.en.svg" alt="Infra diagram with all detectors">&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The clumped up squares represent many detectors at once. Indeed, because some track sections are not represented with their full length, we could not represent all the detectors on the corresponding track section.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Some notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Between some points, we added only one detector (and not two), because they were really close together, and it would have made no sense to create a tiny TVDS between the two. This situation happened on track sections (&lt;em>TA3&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA4&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA5&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TF0&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TG3&lt;/em>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In our infrastructure, there is relatively few track sections which are long enough to require more detectors than just those related to switches. Namely, &lt;em>TA6&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA7&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TDO&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TD1&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TF1&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TG1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TH1&lt;/em>. For example &lt;em>TD0&lt;/em>, which measures 25km, has in fact 17 detectors in total.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="buffer-stops">Buffer stops&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;code>BufferStops&lt;/code> are obstacles designed to prevent trains from sliding off dead ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our infrastructure, there is a buffer stop on each track section which has a loose end. There are therefore 8 buffer stops in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together with detectors, they set the boundaries of &lt;a href="https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/lexique-des-acronymes-sncf/table/?sort=abreviation&amp;amp;q=TVD">TVD&lt;/a> sections (see &lt;a href="#detectors">Detectors&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="routes">Routes&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A &lt;code>Route&lt;/code> is an itinerary in the infrastructure. A train path is a sequence of routes. Routes are used to reserve section of path with the interlocking. See the &lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/fr/developers/internals/simulation-model/">dedicated documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is represented with the following attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>entry_point&lt;/code> and &lt;code>exit_point&lt;/code>: references detectors or buffer stops which mark the beginning and the end of the Route.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>entry_point_direction&lt;/code> : Direction on a track section to start the route from the &lt;code>entry_point&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>switches_direction&lt;/code> : A set of directions to follow when we encounter a switch on our Route, to build this Route from &lt;code>entry_point&lt;/code> to &lt;code>exit_point&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>release_detectors&lt;/code>: When a train clears a release detector, resources reserved from the beginning of the route until this detector are released.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="signaling">Signaling&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Thanks to interlocking, trains are located and allowed to move. It&amp;rsquo;s a good start, but meaningless until trains are made aware of it. This is where &lt;code>Signal&lt;/code>s come into play: signals react to interlocking, and can be seen by trains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How trains react to signals depends on the aspect, kind of signal, and signaling system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the most important attributes for signals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>linked_detector&lt;/code>: The linked &lt;a href="#detectors">detector&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>type_code&lt;/code>: The type of signal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>direction&lt;/code>: The direction it protects, which can simply be interpreted as the way in which it can be seen by an incoming train (since there are lights only on one side&amp;hellip;). Direction is relative to track section orientation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cosmetic attributes like &lt;code>angle_geo&lt;/code> or &lt;code>side&lt;/code> which control the way in which the signals are displayed in the front-end.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a visualization of how one can represent a signal, and which direction it protects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/signal_dir.en.svg" alt="Signal direction example">&lt;/p>
&lt;br/>
&lt;p>The way the signals are arranged is highly dependent on both signaling system and infrastructure manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the basic rules used for this example infrastructure:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We add two spacing signals (one per direction) for each detector that is cutting a long TVD section into smaller ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch entries where a train might have to stop are protected by a signal (which is located outside of the switch TVD section). It must be visible from the direction used to approach the switch. When there are multiple switches in a row, only the first one usually needs protection, as interlocking is usually designed as not to encourage trains stopping in the middle of intersections.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that detectors linked to at least one signal are not represented, as there are not signals without associated detectors in this example.
To get the &lt;code>id&lt;/code> of a detector linked to a signal, take the signal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>id&lt;/code> and replace &lt;em>S&lt;/em> by &lt;em>D&lt;/em> (e.g. SA0 -&amp;gt; DA0).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_signals.drawio.en.svg" alt="Infra diagram with all signals">&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
On &lt;em>TA6&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TA7&lt;/em>, &lt;em>TD0&lt;/em> and &lt;em>TD1&lt;/em> we could not represent all signals because these track sections are very long and have many detectors, hence many signals.
&lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous&lt;/h2>
&lt;/font>
&lt;h4 id="operational-points">Operational points&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;code>OperationalPoints&lt;/code> are collections of points (&lt;code>OperationalPointParts&lt;/code>) of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, it may be convenient to store the location of platforms as parts and group them by station in operational points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the example infrastructure, we only used operational points to represent stations. Operational point parts are displayed as purple diamonds. Keep in mind a single operational point may contain multiple parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="svg_diagrams/small_infra_op_points.drawio.en.svg" alt="Operational points examples">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="loading-gauge-limits">Loading Gauge Limits&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>These objects are akin to &lt;code>Slopes&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Curves&lt;/code>: it covers a range of track section, with a &lt;code>begin&lt;/code> and an &lt;code>end&lt;/code> offset. It represents a restriction on the trains that can travel on the given range, by weight or by train type (freight or passenger).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did not put any in our examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="speed-sections">Speed Sections&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>SpeedSections&lt;/code> represent speed limits (in meters per second) that are applied on some parts of the tracks. One &lt;code>SpeedSection&lt;/code> can span on several track sections, and do not necessarily cover the whole track sections. Speed sections can overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our example infrastructure, we have a speed section covering the whole infrastructure, limiting the speed to 300 km/h. On a smaller part of the infrastructure, we applied more restrictive speed sections.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="the-discontinuity-problem">The discontinuity problem&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When a new graph edge is visited, a simulation is run to evaluate
its speed. But it is not possible to see beyond the current edge.
This makes it difficult to compute braking curves, because
they can span over several edges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="discontinuity.png" alt="Discontinuity">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This example illustrates the problem: by default
the first edge is explored by going at maximum speed.
The destination is only visible once the second edge is visited,
which doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave enough distance to stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="solution--backtracking">Solution : backtracking&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>To solve this problem, when an edge is generated with a
discontinuity in the speed envelopes, the algorithm goes back
over the previous edges to create new ones that include the
decelerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give a simplified example, on a path of 4 edges
where the train can accelerate or decelerate by 10km/h per edge:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="backtracking_1.png" alt="Discontinuity (edge version, 1/2)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the train to stop at the end of route 4, it must be at most
at 10km/h at the end of edge 3. A new edge is then created on
edge 3, which ends at 10km/h. A deceleration is computed
backwards from the end of the edge back to the start,
until the original curve is met (or the start of the edge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, the discontinuity has only been moved to the
transition between edges 2 and 3. The process is then repeated
on edge 2, which gives the following result:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="backtracking_2.png" alt="Discontinuity (edge version, 2/2)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old edges are still present in the graph as they can lead to other solutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Envelopes system</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/envelopes_system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/envelopes_system/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The envelope system is an interface created specifically for the OSRD gait calculation. It allows you to manipulate different space/velocity curves, to slice them, to end them, to interpolate specific points, and to address many other needs necessary for the gait calculation.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service">A specific interface in the OSRD Core service&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The envelope system is part of the core service of OSRD (see &lt;a href="../architecture/_index.md">software architecture&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its main components are :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1 - EnvelopePart:&lt;/strong> space/speed curve, defined as a sequence of points and having metadata indicating for example if it is an acceleration curve, a braking curve, a speed hold curve, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 - Envelope:&lt;/strong> a list of end-to-end EnvelopeParts on which it is possible to perform certain operations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>check for continuity in space (mandatory) and speed (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>look for the minimum and/or maximum speed of the envelope&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cut a part of the envelope between two points in space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>perform a velocity interpolation at a certain position&lt;/li>
&lt;li>calculate the elapsed time between two positions in the envelope&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../envelopes_scheme.png" alt="envelope_scheme">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3 - Overlays :&lt;/strong> system for adding more constrained (i.e. lower speed) EnvelopeParts to an existing envelope.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="given-envelopes-vs-calculated-envelopes">Given envelopes vs. calculated envelopes&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>During the simulation, the train is supposed to follow certain speed instructions. These are modelled in OSRD by envelopes in the form of space/speed curves. Two types can be distinguished:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Envelopes from &lt;strong>infrastructure and rolling stock data&lt;/strong>, such as maximum line speed and maximum train speed. Being input data for our calculation, they do not correspond to curves with a physical meaning, as they are not derived from the results of a real integration of the physical equations of motion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The envelopes result from &lt;strong>real integration&lt;/strong> of the physical equations of motion. They correspond to a curve that is physically tenable by the train and also contain time information.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A simple example to illustrate this difference: if we simulate a TER journey on a mountain line, one of the input data will be a maximum speed envelope of 160km/h, corresponding to the maximum speed of our TER. However, this envelope does not correspond to a physical reality, as it is possible that on certain sections the gradient is too steep for the train to be able to maintain this maximum speed of 160km/h. The calculated envelope will therefore show in this example a speed drop in the steepest areas, where the envelope given was perfectly flat.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="simulation-of-several-trains">Simulation of several trains&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>In the case of the simulation of many trains, the signalling system must ensure &lt;strong>safety&lt;/strong>. The effect of signalling on the running calculation of a train is reproduced by superimposing dynamic envelopes on the static envelope. A new dynamic envelope is introduced for example when a signal closes. The train follows the static economic envelope superimposed on the dynamic envelopes, if any. In this simulation mode, a time check is performed against a theoretical time from the time information of the static economic envelope. If the train is late with respect to the scheduled time, it stops following the economic envelope and tries to go faster. Its space/speed curve will therefore be limited by the maximum effort envelope.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Signaling interface</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/signaling_interface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/signaling_interface/</guid><description>

&lt;h3 id="presentation">Presentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Several applications used within the SNCF group and outside need a &lt;strong>mapping representation of the railway network&lt;/strong>. The OSRD base map uses geographic data from &lt;strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)&lt;/strong>, a &amp;ldquo;Wikipedia of maps&amp;rdquo; that allows collaborative consultation and editing of geographic data. This base map is regularly updated to reflect the evolution of non-rail infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../osrd_management.png" alt="OSRD management">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;OSRD Infrastructure Management**&amp;rdquo; proposes a mapping service accessible to all and shared, based on the same model: everyone will be able to contribute and put in quality the railway data.
We provide on the one hand a &lt;strong>complete editor of the rail network infrastructure and the objects that compose it&lt;/strong>, and on the other hand, &lt;strong>the provision of data layers for their exploitation and representation in the standards of online mapping&lt;/strong>. Finally, we are studying the possibility of **being able to automate the updating of OpenStreetMap&amp;rsquo;s railway data** with the data thus made available.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Conflict avoidance</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/conflict_avoidance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/conflict_avoidance/</guid><description>
&lt;p>While exploring the graph, it is possible to end up in locations that would
generate conflicts. They can be avoided by adding delay.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="shifting-the-departure-time">Shifting the departure time&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The departure time is defined as an interval in the module parameters:
the train can leave at a given time, or up to &lt;code>x&lt;/code> seconds later.
Whenever possible, delay should be added by shifting the departure time.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>for example : a train can leave between 10:00 et 11:00. Leaving
at 10:00 would cause a conflict, the train actually needs to enter the
destination station 15 minutes later. Making the train leave at
10:15 solves the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In OSRD, this feature is handled by keeping track, for every edge,
of the maximum duration by which we can delay the departure time.
As long as this value is enough, conflicts are avoided this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time shift is a value stored in every edge of the path.
Once a path is found, the value is summed over the whole path.
This is added to the departure time.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a train leaves between 10:00 and 11:00. The initial maximum
time shift is 1:00.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At some point, an edge becomes unavailable 20 minutes after the
train passage. The value is now at 20 for any edge accessed from here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The departure time is then delayed by 5 minutes to avoid a conflict.
The maximum time shift value is now at 15 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This process is applied until the destination is found,
or until no more delay can be added this way.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="engineering-allowances">Engineering allowances&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Once the maximum delay is at 0, the delay needs to be added
between two points of the path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="engineering_allowance.png" alt="Engineering allowances (1/2)">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is the same as the one used to fix speed discontinuities:
new edges are created, replacing the previous ones.
The new edges have an engineering allowance, to add the delay where
it is possible.&lt;/p>

a path, without affecting the speeds on the rest of the path.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Pipeline</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/pipeline/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The walk calculation in OSRD is a 4-step process, each using &lt;a href="../envelopes_system">the envelopes system&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="calculation-of-the-most-restricted-speed-profile-mrsp">Calculation of the Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>A first envelope is calculated at the beginning of the simulation by grouping all static velocity limits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>maximum line speed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maximum speed of rolling stock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>temporary speed limits (e.g. in case of works on a line)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>speed limits by train category&lt;/li>
&lt;li>speed limits according to train load&lt;/li>
&lt;li>speed limits corresponding to signposts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The length of the train is also taken into account to ensure that the train does not accelerate until its tail leaves the slowest speed zone. An offset is then applied to the red dashed curve. The resulting envelope (black curve) is called the &lt;strong>Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)&lt;/strong>. It is on this envelope that the following steps will be calculated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../mrsp.png" alt="Most Restricted Speed Profile">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The red dotted line represents the maximum permitted speed depending on the position.
The black line represents the MRSP where the train length has been taken into account.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It should be noted that the different envelopeParts composing the MRSP are input data, so they do not correspond to curves with a physical reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="calculation-of-the-max-speed-profile">Calculation of the Max Speed Profile&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Starting from the MRSP, all braking curves are calculated using the overlay system (see &lt;a href="../envelopes_system/#a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service">here&lt;/a> for more details on overlays), i.e. by creating envelopeParts which will be more restrictive than the MRSP. The resulting curve is called &lt;strong>Max Speed Profile&lt;/strong>. This is the maximum speed envelope of the train, taking into account its braking capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since braking curves have an imposed end point and the braking equation has no analytical solution, it is impossible to predict their starting point. The braking curves are therefore calculated backwards from their target point, i.e. the point in space where a certain speed limit is imposed (finite target speed) or the stopping point (zero target speed).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../msp.png" alt="Max Speed Profile">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For historical reasons in hourly production, braking curves are calculated at SNCF with a fixed deceleration, the so-called hourly deceleration (typically ~0.5m/s²) without taking into account the other forces. This method has therefore also been implemented in OSRD, allowing the calculation of braking in two different ways: with this hourly rate or with a braking force that is simply added to the other forces.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile">Calculation of the Max Effort Profile&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>For each point corresponding to an increase in speed in the MRSP or at the end of a stop braking curve, an acceleration curve is calculated. The acceleration curves are calculated taking into account all active forces (traction force, driving resistance, weight) and therefore have a physical meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For envelopeParts whose physical meaning has not yet been verified (which at this stage are the constant speed running phases, always coming from the MRSP), a new integration of the equations of motion is performed. This last calculation is necessary to take into account possible speed stalls in case the train is physically unable to hold its speed, typically in the presence of steep ramps (see &lt;a href="../envelopes_system/#given-envelopes-vs.-calculated-envelopes">this example&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The envelope that results from the addition of the acceleration curves and the verification of the speed plates is called the &lt;strong>Max Effort Profile&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../mep.png" alt="Max Effort Profile">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this stage, the resulting envelope is continuous and has a physical meaning from start to finish. The train accelerates to the maximum, runs as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum. The resulting travel calculation is called the &lt;strong>basic running time&lt;/strong>. It corresponds to the fastest possible route for the given rolling stock on the given route.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="application-of-allowances">Application of allowance(s)&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>After the calculation of the basic run (corresponding to the Max Effort Profile in OSRD), it is possible to apply allowances. Allowances are additions of extra time to the train&amp;rsquo;s journey. They are used to allow the train to catch up if necessary or for other operational purposes (more details on allowances &lt;a href="../allowances">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new &lt;strong>Allowances&lt;/strong> envelope is therefore calculated using overlays to distribute the allowance requested by the user over the maximum effort envelope calculated previously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../allowances.png" alt="Allowances">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the OSRD running calculation it is possible to distribute the allowances in a linear way, by lowering all speeds by a certain factor, or in an economic way, i.e. by minimising the energy consumption during the train run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Contribute code</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/guides/contribute/code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/guides/contribute/code/</guid><description>

&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="definition">Definition&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>In order to define the Short Term Digital Capacity Management (STDCM) path, we first need to define what a path is, as well as the actors involved. A &lt;strong>path&lt;/strong> is the reservation of space/time on the network. It is an &lt;strong>RC&lt;/strong> (railway company) that orders the path, and the &lt;strong>IM&lt;/strong> (infrastructure manager) that provides the route. When we talk about &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; train paths, the reservation request is made several years in advance (A-3), and the IM produces a document in which we can find all the requests with their assigned capacity on the network. &lt;strong>Capacity&lt;/strong> is the total amount of track available on the rail network of a IM. It is divided between commercial capacity, intended for RCs, and work capacity, which, as its name indicates, is reserved for the various works planned on the tracks. As a preventive measure and in order to be able to manage certain contingencies (delays, technical or environmental problems), the rate of reserved train paths may not exceed 75% of the total capacity of the network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the last minute groove comes in. If there are no problems, the IM is left with about 25% of its capacity unused. So if an RC needs a path urgently (between A-1 and up to a few minutes before the rolling stock is due to depart), it can apply for a STDCM.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="challenges-and-ambitions">Challenges and ambitions&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The STDCMs are currently managed by the capacity counter between A-1 and D-1, and by the operational counter from D-1 to 5 pm. Several problems arise from this; the request is tedious and the response from the counters is asynchronous (taking several days to respond), the paths are traced by hand (risk of human error) and the billing can get lost in the operations, it is estimated that tens of millions of euros are lost due to unbilled STDCM. Some digital tools already know how to solve these problems, but they do not take into account conflict management on the network, or if they do, they do not know how to manage it at the station.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is in response to these challenges that the idea of offering digital management of last-minute train paths was born. The objective is to allow RCs to book train paths easily, by proposing a calculation of the STDCM within the theoretical forecast capacity, and by providing them with a quick response (about 3 minutes waiting time). Customers could also choose between several calculation modes. This tool is under development and should be available in the next few years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Conflict detection</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/conflict-detection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/conflict-detection/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-warning">
&lt;p>This document is a work in progress&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Conflict detection is a process which enables figuring out if a timetable,
comprised of many train paths, can be performed as planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a train has to slow down because of another train, or undergoing work on
rail infrastructure, these actors are in conflict, which causes the timetable
to become impossible to perform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conflict detection relies on interlocking and signaling simulation to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>figure out what each actor requires to perform its duty undisturbed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>detect conflicting requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This system has to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>produce conflicts which can be linked back to a root cause&lt;/li>
&lt;li>operate in way that can be visualized and interpreted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>be scalable: it should work just as fast given a massive number of train paths to intersect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enable threading new train paths into an existing timetable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The design of this system is guided by a number of constraints:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>it must not cause false-negatives&lt;/strong>: if no conflicts are detected, a multi-train simulation of the same timetable must not yield any slowdowns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it cannot rely on data we do not have&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it has to enable later support of mobile block systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it has to rely on existing signaling and interlocking simulation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it has to enable detecting conflicts regardless of the signaling system in use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it has to support transitions between signaling systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it has to support conflicts between different signaling systems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conflict-theory">Conflict theory&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Conflict detection relies on an abstract model:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>objects where conflicts happen are resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>resources are used by actors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>resource uses can be incompatible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>overlapping incompatible ressource uses generate a conflict&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="actors">Actors&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Actors are objects which cause resources to be used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>train paths&lt;/strong> (or someone / something on the behalf of the train)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>planned infrastructure work&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="resources">Resources&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Resources have the following properties:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>can be used by actors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>have multiple states&lt;/li>
&lt;li>can only be in a single state at any given time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>may take time changing state&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The current model only considers the following two resources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>zones&lt;/strong>, which have one state per way to traverse it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>switches&lt;/strong>, which have one state per position&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-info">
&lt;p>Station platforms could also be resources, which would enable modeling platform use conflicts: if two tracks share a tiny platform, it may not be allowed to use both sides of the platform at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="requirements-and-conflicts">Requirements and conflicts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>requirement&lt;/strong> describes what resource is needed by an actor, and when.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few types of requirements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>shareable&lt;/strong>: the resource is required to be in a given configuration, for a given time lapse. Other shareable requirements with the same configuration can stack up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>exclusive&lt;/strong>: the resource is required to be in a given configuration, for a given actor, for a given time lapse. This requirement cannot be combined with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conflicts&lt;/strong> are both real-life disturbances and the incompatible resource requirements which cause them. A disturbance is something that would cause a train to be unable to run as planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>route setup delays due to unavailable resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>spacing conflicts due to a train catching up with another&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These real-life issues can be linked to conflicts, which arise from incompatible resource requirements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>an exclusive requirement overlaps another requirement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a shareable requirements overlaps an incompatible requirement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a resource does not have time to change state between non-overlapping, yet close, requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For example, there are &lt;strong>no&lt;/strong> conflicts when:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a resource has non-overlapping exclusive requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a resource is shared by requirements which require the same configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="generating-requirements">Generating requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For conflict detection to work, resource requirements have to strictly match what&amp;rsquo;s required
to garantee that a simulated train will not be disturbed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="routing-requirements">Routing requirements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For a train to be routed across rail infrastructure without any trouble, some resources have to
be available for routes to set in time. A route does not set in time if a train is disturbed by
a route being set too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A route might be set too late for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one of the zones required may be unavailable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a switch may be unavailable, or still moving&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Routing requirements are generated by the following algorithm:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>compute a route calling timeline, so that the train never slows down due to late route setting.
It can be done by finding when the driver would be constrained by signaling, and using that minus an allowance as the deadline.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for each zone in each route, simulate when it would be released, and thus not required anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use the route calling deadline as the requirement start time for each zone, and the release time as the requirement end. It is a shareable requirement.
Switch requirements use the same time bounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-info">
&lt;p>Implementing route overlaps alternatives would require a richer model for requirements, such as a hierarchy and alternatives&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="spacing-requirements">Spacing requirements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Trains can also be slowed down by catching up with another train.
When this happens, signaling forces the following train to slow down,
or even stop if the train being followed does not clear the way fast enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These slowdowns are conflicts, and thus need to be avoided by emitting sufficient requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>At any time, exclusive requirements are emitted for zones which if occupied, would trigger a slowdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These requirements are emitted as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the route calling timeline is followed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>every time the driver sees a signal:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>start by assuming routes reserved for routing should be reserved for spacing as well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>until the driver sees a signal which would cause a slowdown:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>attempt to make the last reserved zone occupied by a virtual train&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if the signal now causes a slowdown, the currently reserved zones are correct, continue to the next signal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if not, unreserve the last zone of the path&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="the-purpose-of-allowances">The purpose of allowances&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>As explained in the &lt;a href="../pipeline/#calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile">calcul du Max Effort Profile&lt;/a>, the &lt;strong>basic running time&lt;/strong> represents the most stretched run normally achievable, i.e. the fastest possible run of the given equipment on the given route. The train accelerates to the maximum, travels as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This basic run has a major disadvantage: if a train leaves 10 minutes late, it will arrive at best 10 minutes late, because by definition it is impossible for it to run faster than the basic run. Therefore, trains are scheduled with one or more allowances added. The allowances are a relaxation of the train&amp;rsquo;s route, an addition of time to the scheduled timetable, which inevitably results in a lowering of running speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A train running in basic gear is unable to catch up!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="allowances-types">Allowances types&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>There are two types of allowances:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The regularity allowance&lt;/strong>: this is the additional time added to the basic running time to take account of the inaccuracy of speed measurement, to compensate for the consequences of external incidents that disrupt the theoretical run of trains, and to maintain the regularity of the traffic. The regularity allowance applies to the whole route, although its value may change at certain intervals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The construction allowance&lt;/strong>: this is the time added/removed on a specific interval, in addition to the regularity allowance, but this time for operational reasons (dodging another train, clearing a track more quickly, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A basic running time with an added allowance of regularity gives what is known as a &lt;strong>standard walk&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="allowance-distribution">Allowance distribution&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Since the addition of allowance results in lower speeds along the route, there are a number of possible routes. Indeed, there are an infinite number of solutions that result in the same journey time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a simple example, in order to reduce the running time of a train by 10% of its journey time, it is possible to extend any stop by the time equivalent to this 10%, just as it is possible to run at 1/1.1 = 90.9% of the train&amp;rsquo;s capacity over the entire route, or to run slower, but only at high speeds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are currently two algorithms for margin distribution in OSRD: linear and economic.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="linear-distribution">Linear distribution&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>Linear allowance distribution is simply lowering the speeds by the same factor over the area where the user applies the allowance. Here is an example of its application:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../python_plot_linear.png" alt="Python plot linear">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantage of this distribution is that the allowance is spread evenly over the entire journey. A train that is late on 30% of its journey will have 70% of its allowance for the remaining 70% of its journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;font color=#aa026d>
&lt;h3 id="economic-distribution">Economic distribution&lt;/h3>
&lt;/font>
&lt;p>The economic distribution of the allowance, presented in detail in &lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/pdf/MARECO.pdf">this document&lt;/a> (&lt;strong>MARECO&lt;/strong> is an algorithm designed by the SNCF research department), consists of distributing the allowance in the most energy-efficient way possible. It is based on two principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>a maximum speed, avoiding the most energy-intensive speeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run-on zones, located before braking and steep gradients, where the train runs with the engine off thanks to its inertia, allowing it to consume no energy during this period&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../python_plot_eco_w_slopes.png" alt="Python plot eco with slopes">&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Docs: Standard allowance</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/standard_allowance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/design-docs/stdcm/pathfinding_module/standard_allowance/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The STDCM module must be usable with
&lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/allowances/" title="marge de régularité">standard allowances&lt;/a>.
The user can set an allowance value, expressed either as a function of
the running time or the travelled distance. This time must be added to the
running time, so that it arrives later compared to its fastest possible
running time.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example: the user can set a margin of 5 minutes per 100km.
On a 42km long path that would take 10 minutes at best,
the train should arrive 12 minutes and 6 seconds after leaving.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This can cause problems to detect conflicts, as an allowance would move
the end of the train slot to a later time.
The allowance must be considered when we compute conflicts as
the graph is explored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The allowance must also follow the &lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/pdf/MARECO.pdf">MARECO&lt;/a> model:
the extra time isn&amp;rsquo;t added evenly over the whole path,
it is computed in a way that requires knowing the whole path.
This is done to optimize the energy used by the train.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="linear-margin-expressed-as-a-function-of-time">Linear margin expressed as a function of time&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a first step, the problem is solved with a linear margin,
i.e. added evenly over the whole path.
The speed is simply modified by a constant factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/envelopes_system/" title="envelopes">envelopes&lt;/a>.
computed during the graph traversal are not modified, they are always
at maximum speed. But they are paired with a speed factor, which is used
to compute running time and to evaluate conflicts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final envelope, with the allowance, is only computed once a path
is found.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="linear-margin-expressed-as-a-function-of-distance">Linear margin expressed as a function of distance&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The principle is generally the same, but with an extra difficulty:
the speed factor isn&amp;rsquo;t constant over the path.
When a train goes faster, it travels more distance in the same time,
which increases the allowance time and the speed factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the train speed changes over the path, the speed factor
changes from one edge to another. This causes irregular speed curves.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="mareco-allowances">MARECO Allowances&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is exclusively a post-processing step,
because it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to compute the MARECO envelope
without knowing the full train path.
When looking for a path, linear allowances are used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that conflicts may appear at this step.
To avoid them, the following procedure is applied:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A mareco allowance is applied over the whole path.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If there are conflict, the first one is considered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mareco allowance is &lt;em>split in two intervals&lt;/em>.
The point where the first conflict appeared is set
to be at the same time as the envelope with a linear allowance,
removing the conflict at this point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This process is repeated iteratively until no conflict is found.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This page is about implementation details.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary to understand general principles,
but it helps before reading the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="stdcmedgebuilder">STDCMEdgeBuilder&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This refers to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/src/main/java/fr/sncf/osrd/stdcm/graph/STDCMEdgeBuilder.java">this class&lt;/a>
in the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This class is used to make it easier to create instances of
&lt;code>STDCMEdge&lt;/code>, the graph edges. Those contain many attributes,
most of which can be determined from the context (e.g. the
previous node).
The &lt;code>STDCMEdgeBuilder&lt;/code> class makes some parameters optional
and automatically computes others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once instantiated and parametrized, an &lt;code>STDCMEdgeBuilder&lt;/code> has two methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Collection&amp;lt;STDCMEdge&amp;gt; makeAllEdges()&lt;/code> can be used to create all
the possible edges in the given context for a given route.
If there are several &amp;ldquo;openings&amp;rdquo; between occupancy blocks, one edge
is instantiated for each opening. Every conflict, their avoidance,
and their related attributes are handled here.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>STDCMEdge findEdgeSameNextOccupancy(double timeNextOccupancy)&lt;/code>:
This method is used to get the specific edges that uses a certain
opening (when it exists), identified here with the time of the next
occupancy block. It is called whenever a new edge must be re-created
to replace an old one. It calls the previous method.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pathfinding">Pathfinding&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The methods mentioned here are defined in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/src/main/java/fr/sncf/osrd/stdcm/graph/STDCMPathfinding.java">this class&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cost-function">Cost function&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The function used to define pathfinding cost sets which path
is used over another. The result is always the one that minimizes
this cost (as long as the heuristic is admissible).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, two parameters are used: total run time and departure time.
The latter has a very small weight compared to the former,
so that the fastest path is found. More details
are explained in the documentation of those methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="heuristics">Heuristics&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The algorithm used to find a path is an A*, with a heuristic based
on geographical coordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the coordinates of generated infrastructures are arbitrary
and don&amp;rsquo;t reflect the track distance. It means that,
for the generated infrastructures, the path may not always be the
shortest one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be possible to use this heuristic to determine whether
the current node can lead to a path that doesn&amp;rsquo;t take
longer than the maximum allowed total run time. But for the same
reason, adding this feature would break any STDCM test on generated
infras. More details in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/issues/2818">this issue&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About: Open Source</title><link>https://osrd.fr/en/about/opensource/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osrd.fr/en/about/opensource/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Open source is a &lt;strong>software development practice&lt;/strong>, where the software&amp;rsquo;s source code&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>usually developped by multiple actors, in an open and transparent way&lt;/li>
&lt;li>free and available for all&lt;/li>
&lt;li>can be modified or used for derivative work by anyone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>can be freely distributed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In practice, open source is both a &lt;strong>legal framework&lt;/strong> for collaborative work, and a &lt;strong>set of practices&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="osrd-and-open-source">OSRD and Open Source&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Applied to OSRD, Open Source has &lt;strong>multiple avantages&lt;/strong> :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the algorigthms and know-how developped with the project are free for all&lt;/li>
&lt;li>development cost and results are shared between actors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it makes interoperability between software systems easier by making helping make the landscape more homogeneous and standardized&lt;/li>
&lt;li>helps focus collaboration around common interests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enables actors to tailor the software to their own interests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enables researchers to contribute and benefit from the project&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it allows public actors to meet their transparency goals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using open source to enable industrial collaboration is not a new idea:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Blender&lt;/strong> is a modelling, rendering and 3D animation software, which has recently become &lt;a href="https://fund.blender.org/">major point of industry collaboration&lt;/a> for this industry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Linux&lt;/strong>, a Windows alternative used by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, most websites, cloud platforms, mobile phones, routers, and more. All these companies rely on and contribute to Linux tremendously&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Android&lt;/strong> is the common base software for most phones. Phone manufacturers regularly contribute to android&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>PostgreSQL&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>MySQL&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>SQLite&lt;/strong> and other open source data bases collectively dominate the database market. Any actor with special needs can improve an existing open source tool rather than create a new one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both &lt;strong>Firefox&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Chrome&lt;/strong> are Open Source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wordpress&lt;/strong> is the CMS which runs 43% of all websites. A flock of companies contribute to Wordpress and make extensions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Odoo&lt;/strong> is a powerful modular ERP, which has a community not unlike Wordpress&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All these projects share the common property of being essential to a number of companies, without being part of what these companies sell.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It thus makes sense for these companies to collaborate with peers and competitors to build common tools, which makes exchanges easier and helps improve quality of service for all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="processes">Processes&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
These processes are not specific to open source: many companies work in a similar way.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In practice, most open source software is developed using &lt;a href="https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd">a forge&lt;/a>. Through this forge, developers and users can access the source code, report bugs, plan tasks, and integrate new changes to the code.
Anyone can suggest a change, report a bug or plan a task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All changes go through a &lt;strong>peer review&lt;/strong>, not unlike those used by the scientific community.
Reviewers are software developers most familiar with components affected by the change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changes are integrated into the code base when everyone involved agrees to.
Maintainers are responsible for keeping the project working and consistent. Maintainers are choosen among developers by developers.
What motivates whether to integrate a change or not is technical viability: the goal of everyone involved is to &lt;strong>maintain high level of service and quality standard&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Open Data is the practice of making data public accessible under a permissive license.
It is not the same as open source, which only applies to software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Open data and open source have a symbiotic relationship : without open data, an open source railway software can only be used by industry insiders. Managing data access is hard, expensive, often not necessary, and reduces the availability of critical data.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alone, &lt;strong>open data&lt;/strong> already brings a number of key benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>companies can use open data in their products, which also promotes railway services&lt;/li>
&lt;li>researchers can study the data immediately, and can find the data by themselves&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Yet, &lt;strong>open data&lt;/strong> used by an &lt;strong>open source toolbox&lt;/strong> open up new prospects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>companies and researchers can use the open source tools to analyse the data, which greatly reduces the barrier to entry by alleviating the need for custom or paid-for tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>customers can use the toolbox to improve how they use railway services&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If &lt;strong>multiple actors&lt;/strong> have open data exploitable by an open source tool, these datasets can be &lt;strong>combined&lt;/strong> and used to &lt;strong>provide and plan for common services&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="osrd-and-open-data">OSRD and Open Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>having &lt;strong>rolling stock&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>infrastructure&lt;/strong> open data enables anyone to &lt;strong>simulate trains&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>study&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>evaluate&lt;/strong> the railway network&lt;/li>
&lt;li>having &lt;strong>timetable&lt;/strong> open data enables anyone to &lt;strong>study&lt;/strong> rail network usage&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="context">Context&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The onboard computer of ETCS-enabled trains has to compute a number of position / speed curves.
Here is how it works:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>below all the curves, the speed indicator is white&lt;/li>
&lt;li>above the indication curve, the speed indicator is yellow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>above the permitted curve, the speed indicator is orange&lt;/li>
&lt;li>above the warning curve, an alarm rings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>above the intervention curves, an emergency break intervention is triggered&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="inputs">Inputs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to compute any of these curves, a number of things are needed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>target data (the destination of the braking curve, which can be EOA and SvL or LOA and MRSP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>train data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>infrastructure data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>infrastructure manager constants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>standardized constants&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="train">Train&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>max speed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>length&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rotating mass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>T_traction_cutoff&lt;/code>: the time it take to cut off traction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>braking model, either lambda or gamma:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>lambda (braking weight/mass)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gamma (contant deceleration at a given speed)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>correction factors (k_dry and k_wet for gamma braking) for braking curves&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>corrected gradients (it incorporates curvature)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>odometry balises location&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="processes">Processes&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="braking-coefficients">Braking coefficients:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>A_brake_emergency&lt;/code> is the expected emergency braking capability, without safety margins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>A_brake_safe&lt;/code> is the emergency braking coefficient, &lt;strong>with&lt;/strong> safety margins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>A_brake_service&lt;/code> is the expected service braking capability, without safety margins&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="speed--distance-targets">Speed / distance targets&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>EOA&lt;/code> end of movement authority: the location until which the train is allowed to move&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>SvL&lt;/code> supervized location: the protected location&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="curves">Curves&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>SBD&lt;/code> supervised braking deceleration: intermediary result computed from &lt;code>EOA&lt;/code> and &lt;code>A_brake_service&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>EBD&lt;/code> emergency braking deceleration: intermediary result computed from &lt;code>SvL&lt;/code> and &lt;code>A_brake_safe&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All the curves below are cut below a given release speed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>EBI&lt;/code> (emergency break intervention) computed from &lt;code>EBD&lt;/code>, shifted in position and space given rolling stock metadata&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>SBI1&lt;/code> computed from &lt;code>SBD&lt;/code>, shifted in &lt;strong>time&lt;/strong> with &lt;code>Tbs1&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>SBI2&lt;/code> computed from &lt;code>SBD&lt;/code>, shifted in &lt;strong>time&lt;/strong> with &lt;code>Tbs2&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>FLOI&lt;/code> (also called &lt;code>SBI&lt;/code>, the intervention curve) the minimum of &lt;code>SBI1&lt;/code> and &lt;code>SBI2&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>WARNING&lt;/code> (warning curve) computed as a shift of &lt;code>FLOI&lt;/code> by &lt;code>Twarning&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>PS&lt;/code> (permitted speed curve): shift of &lt;code>WARNING&lt;/code> by time &lt;code>Tdriver&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>INDICATION&lt;/code> is a shift of &lt;code>PS&lt;/code> by time &lt;code>Tindication&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
