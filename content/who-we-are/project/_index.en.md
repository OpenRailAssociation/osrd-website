The process of planning the circulation of a train requires **10 years of anticipation** and involves the collaboration of different services and actors to transform the mobility needs of customers: The process of planning a train requires **10 years of anticipation** and involves the collaboration of different departments and actors to transform the mobility needs of customers: **organizing authorities (OA)** and **railway companies (RC)** into **annual service (AS)**.

The OSRD project aims to meet the needs of simulations that cover the entire process, from the design of the transportation plan to its operation.

Our mission is to provide a simulation tool that can be used in **all stages of the design phase** (timetable planning and operational studies), on a **national geographic scale** (including the whole French network) and with a **variable detail size**. Moreover, in the operational phase, the OSRD project proposes a service to draw **last minute paths** (time-slot during which the infrastructure is allocated to the circulation of a specific train) in the theoretical or real residual capacity of the railway network, once the other circulations have already been planned.
