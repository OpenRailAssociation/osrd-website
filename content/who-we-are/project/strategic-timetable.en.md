A first phase of the transportation plan design process starts very early: Y-10 of the day the train is to run and aims to **propose several traffic scenarios** on existing or prospective rail infrastructure. In this phase, SNCF Réseau, the French railway infrastructure manager and responsible for the allocation and sale of train paths, collects requests from **OA** and **RC** in terms of mobility. The requests will be transmitted in the form of **service plans**. A service plan is a way of representing the requested trains, their route and the stops to be served.

The **OSRD Strategic Schedules** product has been designed to build an operating plan from the service diagrams, based on **rail infrastructure modeling, running calculation and simulation**. Building an operating plan means scheduling the trains presented on the service diagrams in a way that best meets the mobility needs. The OSRD tool provides a database with a **micro-model of the French railway infrastructure** as well as the **rolling stock already in use in France**. Moreover, an interface to modify the existing infrastructure or to design a new part of the infrastructure is proposed (we tried to guarantee the ergonomics necessary for the creativity of this design work!) The output products of the "**OSRD Strategic Schedules**" process are timetables where the train schedules are displayed. A graphical representation of the timetables is thus proposed.

A comprehensive and strategic view of the timetable planning is crucial to improve rail performance. **The ultimate goal is to meet mobility needs by optimizing line capacity utilization, station track occupancy and material turnover**. To meet this optimization requirement, we are working to implement mathematical modeling and resolution modules coupled with the simulator.
