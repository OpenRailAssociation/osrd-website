### <font color=#aa026d>Open data is one of the main digital challenges</font>

The opening of data promotes transparency and information, removes barriers to accessibility and use, and is a tremendous gas pedal of innovation.

On the rail system side, the SNCF has been committed for a few years to making data available for its passenger transport activities. The company produces a very large amount of data: timetables, equipment and services in stations, regularity, lines and connections, accessibility, etc.

We are working every day to continue this opening up! Indeed, some data that are still classified as confidential are no longer classified as industrial secrets (e.g., data useful for calculating the speed and spacing of trains). The declassification of this non-sensitive data is essential for the operation of certain open source tools, whose performance depends heavily on shared data.
