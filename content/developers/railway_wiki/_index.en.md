Unfortunately, developping railway software is hard. The main reason why might just be that
railway systems both extremely complicated and easy to simplify. As the cost of training a
software developper to be a railway expert from the get go is enormous, training usually
occurs as needed.

This lack of initial detailed understanding makes it very, very easy for software engineers
to model railway systems incorrectly, only to realize their mistake once it's too late.

This wiki is meant to help software engineers have a deep understanding of railway systems.
