## Introduction

Sub categories are created via a dedicated API. Each sub category has a name and a unique code, as well as visual properties like **color**, **hovered_color**, and **background_color**.
Each sub category is associated with a parent main category.
Both **TrainSchedules** and **PacedTrains** can specify either a **main_category** or a user-defined **sub_category_code**.

### SubCategory model

```yml
name: "RER"
code: "RER"
main_category: "COMMUTER_TRAIN"
color: "#FF0000"
hovered_color: "#FFA500"
background_color: "#FFD700"
```

### Train Schedule & Paced Train Category

The category field in train schedules and paced trains can take either:

```yml
category:
  main_category: "COMMUTER_TRAIN"
```

Or

```yml
category:
  sub_category_code: "RER"
```

Only one of the two can be defined at a time, or both can be absent.

If a referenced sub category is deleted, the affected train schedules or paced trains will automatically fall back to the sub categoryâ€™s associated **main_category**.
