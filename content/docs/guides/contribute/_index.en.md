First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following chapters are a set of guidelines for contributing to OSRD[^guidelines-not-rules]. If you have already contributed to open source projects before, you probably won't be surprised.
If you have not, it will probably help a lot!

### Communicate

Chatting with other contributors is a great way to speed things up:

- Join our instant messaging room on IRC at [libera.chat#osrd](https://web.libera.chat/#osrd)
- [**Create an issue**](https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/issues/new/choose) to discuss your contribution project

### Inquire

Just like with any project, changes rely on past work.
Before making changes, it is best to learn about what's already there:

- [read technical documentation]({{< ref "/docs" >}})
- read the existing source code related to your project
- chat with developers who last worked on areas you are interested in

[^guidelines-not-rules]: These guidelines are mostly not strict rules, it's probably fine to do things slightly differently.
