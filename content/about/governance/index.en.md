OSRD is currently developed by a [team of full-time developers at SNCF Réseau](../../join-us), financed by SNCF Réseau, the French state and the European Union.

One of the ambitions of OSRD is to help with **timetabling on a European scale**.

To reach this goal, OSRD has to take local features into account by consulting and collaborating with railway companies, infrastructure operators, research teams and any other interested actors.

If you are a company/team wanting to:

- Profit from all the common development efforts
- Freely build on the common effort to achieve your own goals[^license]
- Participate in the roadmap and technical direction of the project to the extent of your contribution

## OpenRail Association

The [OpenRail Association](https://openrailassociation.org/) is a non-profit co-founded by SNCF Réseau committed to organizing cooperative work around open-source railway software tools.
OSRD is the first project hosted by the OpenRail Association and we work alongside another OpenRail project: [NGE](../../docs/explanation/netzgrafik-editor/).
