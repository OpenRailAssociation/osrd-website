One of the ambitions of OSRD is to help with **timetabling on a European scale**.

To reach this goal, OSRD has to take local features into account by consulting and collaborating with railway companies and infrastructure operators.

And by contributing to OSRD, these companies:
 - Profit from all the common development efforts
 - Can freely build on the common effort to achieve their own goals[^license]
 - Participate in the roadmap and technical direction of the project to the extent of their contribution

[^license]: As long as they don't modify the common tools without sharing their improvements. See the details of the [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) license.

OSRD is currently developped by:
- A team of full-time developpers at SNCF Réseau, financed by SNCF Réseau, the French state and the European Union
- Individual contributors

## The Open Rail Foundation

The [Open Rail Foundation](https://openrailfoundation.gitlab.io/) is an upcoming non-profit commited to organizing cooperative work around railway software tools.
