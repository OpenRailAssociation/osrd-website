# OSRD WEBSITE

## What is OSRD?

OSRD is a work in progress tool meant to help design and operate railway infrastructure.
It's built around a simulator, which evaluates a timetable on a given infrastructure.

It's free and open-source forever!

## Build instructions

### Local

- `npm install` to install all the project dependencies
- `npm run start` to get a development server
- `npm run build` to make a production build

### With docker

#### Download & install hugo image with dependencies

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    --entrypoint npm \
    hugomods/hugo:exts \
    install
```

#### Development server

```
# starts hugo using the hugomods/hugo:exts docker image
./hugo.sh server
```

#### Build

```
# by default, it just builds the site
./hugo.sh
```

## Spell Checker

```
cspell --config cspell/cspell.json
```

If you need to use a specific word that isn't in the dictionaries, you can add it to the correct `.txt` dictionary in the `cspell` folder.
