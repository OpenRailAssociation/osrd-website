# Contributing to OSRD website

## Getting oriented

The OSRD project has 2 primary repos:

1. [`osrd`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd): This is where the
simulator is developed.
2. [`osrd-website`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd-website): Where
the [`official website`](https://osrd.fr), blog, documentation, ... are hosted.

This is the website repo. For more info on the project or to contribute to the
project itself checkout the [Contributing](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file of the main repo.

## Contributing

All contributions, documentation improvements, typo fixes and ideas are welcome. 

If you need help or want to get in touch you can email us at <contact@osrd.fr>, chat via [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#public-general:osrd.fr) or [ask a question on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/discussions/categories/q-a).

To comply with the [DCO](http://developercertificate.org/), all commits must
include a Signed-off-by line. You can find more information about this on [our website](https://osrd.fr/en/docs/guides/contribute/contribute-code/commit-conventions/#the-developer-certificate-of-origin).

### Guidelines

Providing both `_index.fr.md` and `_index.en.md` is required to have a table of contents consistent between languages.

#### Sharing images

If you are adding images to the website, please make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Images that are meant to be used in multiple places should be placed in the `static/images/` directory.
- Images that are specific to a blog post or documentation page should be placed in the same directory as the corresponding markdown file.
- Use descriptive filenames for images to make it easier to identify their purpose.
