# Contributing to OSRD website

## Getting oriented

The OSRD project has 2 primary repos:

1. [`osrd`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd): This is where the
simulator is developed.
2. [`osrd-website`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd-website): Where
the [`official website`](https://osrd.fr), blog, documentation, ... are hosted.

This is the website repo. For more info on the project or to contribute to the
project itself checkout the [Contributing](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file of the main repo.
